# Cayo Perico Loot Calculator

A modern, responsive, and feature-rich loot calculator for the Cayo Perico Heist in GTA Online.

## 🌟 Features

-   **Smart Loot Calculation**: Accurately calculates potential payouts based on available secondary loot, primary target, and bag capacity.
-   **Dynamic Crew Cuts**:
    -   Automatically manages crew cuts with a 15% minimum enforcement.
    -   Leader's cut auto-adjusts as you change crew percentages.
    -   Handles 1-4 players seamlessly.
-   **Optimization Strategy**:
    -   **"Leader's Strategy" Dashboard**: Real-time comparison of your potential take across Solo, Duo, Trio, and Squad scenarios.
    -   Highlights the **Best Option** (Green) and warns of suboptimal choices (Red).
    -   Accounts for specific rules like Solo players not being able to pick up Gold (unless glitching).
-   **Mission Modifiers**:
    -   **Hard Mode**: +10% Primary Target value.
    -   **Elite Challenge**: Toggle for the bonus payout.
    -   **Solo Gold Glitch**: Specific toggle for solo runs.
-   **Optimal Bagging Logic**: Suggests exactly what to bag (e.g., "1.5 bags of Gold, remainder Cash") to maximize value.
-   **Persistent Settings**: Your configuration (players, loot tables, toggles) is saved automatically to your browser's local storage.
-   **Dark/Forest Theme**: Premium dark-mode aesthetic using the DaisyUI Forest theme.

## 📊 How It Works

1.  **Select Players**: Choose between 1 to 4 players.
2.  **Enter Loot**: Input the quantity of Gold, Cocaine, Weed, Paintings, and Cash found during scoping.
3.  **Adjust Cuts**: Set the cuts for your crew members. The calculator ensures a fair minimum (15%) and updates the Leader's share.
4.  **Review Strategy**: Check the "Leader's Optimization Strategy" card to see if you should add or remove players to make more money personally.
